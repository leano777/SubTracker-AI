### 9. CI/CD Integration ‚úÖ
- **Created `.github/workflows/test.yml`** with:
  - Multi-stage pipeline (quality gates, unit, integration, performance)
  - Coverage reporting with Codecov integration
  - Performance regression detection
  - PR comment generation for test results
  - Build verification
  - Comprehensive test result aggregation

### 10. Documentation ‚úÖ
- **Created `src/test/README.md`** with detailed documentation covering:
  - Test structure and organization
  - Running tests locally and in CI
  - Writing new tests and best practices
  - Debugging and troubleshooting
  - Performance testing guidelines
  - Coverage requirements
  - Contributing guidelines

## ‚úÖ Basic Test Verification
- **Created and verified `src/test/basic.test.ts`** - ‚úÖ PASSING
- Test environment is properly configured and functional

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues to Address

### Mock Configuration
The complex test files contain advanced mocking that may need refinement:
- Supabase client mocking in context tests
- DataSyncManager mocking in hook tests
- Module hoisting issues with vi.mock()

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Simplify Mock Setup**: Create a centralized mock configuration
2. **Mock Factory Functions**: Use factory patterns for consistent mocking
3. **Module Boundary Testing**: Test real implementations where possible
4. **Integration Test Refinement**: Ensure components render without mock conflicts

## üéØ Test Coverage Goals

| Category | Target Coverage | Current Status |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Hooks | 85%+ | Tests created ‚úÖ |
| Contexts | 80%+ | Tests created ‚úÖ |
| Integration Flows | 70%+ | Tests created ‚úÖ |
| Performance | Baseline established | Tests created ‚úÖ |
