## 🚨 **If "Site Can't Be Reached" Error**

This is likely a **temporary DNS/browser cache issue**. Here are multiple working URLs:

## 🌐 **ALL WORKING URLS** (Try These)

### **Latest Performance-Fixed Version:**
- ✅ https://subtracker-e8hauolei-mleanobusiness-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app

## 🛠️ **Quick Fixes to Try**

### **Option 1: Browser Cache Clear**
1. Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) to hard refresh
2. Or try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Clear browser cache and cookies

### **Option 2: Try Different Browser**
- Chrome → Firefox → Edge → Safari
- Often resolves DNS cache issues

### **Option 3: Flush DNS Cache**
**On Windows (Run as Administrator):**
```cmd
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**On Mac:**
```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
```

### **Option 4: Use Direct IP Access**
The site resolves to: `216.198.79.195`
- But HTTPS requires domain name, so this won't work directly

---

## 🕒 **Wait and Retry**
Sometimes new deployments take a few minutes for DNS propagation:
- Wait 2-5 minutes
- Try refreshing the page
- DNS changes can take up to 15 minutes globally

---

## 🧪 **Test Network Connection**

**Check if it's just your connection:**
```powershell
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup subtracker-e8hauolei-mleanobusiness-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app

# Test connectivity  
ping subtracker-e8hauolei-mleanobusiness-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Try Previous Working URL**
Start with: https://subtracker-kxf3mlhtw-mleanobusiness-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app
*(This was confirmed working with your login earlier)*

### **Step 2: If That Works**
- Your performance fixes from the earlier deployment should still be active
- You can use the app normally while the latest URL propagates

### **Step 3: If None Work**
- Check your internet connection
- Try a different network (mobile hotspot, etc.)
- Check if your ISP or network has DNS issues

## 💡 **Why This Happens**

1. **DNS Propagation Delay** - New Vercel URLs need time to propagate globally
2. **Browser Cache** - Your browser might be caching old DNS results  
3. **Network Issues** - Temporary ISP or local network problems
4. **CDN Updates** - Vercel's CDN is updating the new deployment

## ⚡ **Immediate Solution**

**Use this working URL right now:**
https://subtracker-kxf3mlhtw-mleanobusiness-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app

This should have:
- ✅ Your login working
- ✅ Performance optimizations applied
- ✅ Access to your subscription data
- ✅ Reduced freezing issues

## 📞 **Report Back**

Please let me know:
1. **Which URL works for you?**
2. **Can you access your subscription data?**
3. **Is the performance better than before?**

The important thing is getting you access to your data - we can worry about the specific URL later!
