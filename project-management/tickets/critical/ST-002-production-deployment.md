- [ ] No build or deployment errors
- [ ] Application loads and renders correctly

## Technical Notes
### Current Status:
- Vercel project: `mleanobusiness-gmailcoms-projects/subtracker-ai`
- Environment variables configured for both dev and production
- Build currently failing due to TypeScript errors (blocking dependency: ST-001)

### Implementation Steps:
1. Wait for ST-001 (TypeScript fixes) to complete
2. Trigger production deployment via `npx vercel --prod`
3. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
4. Test production URL accessibility
5. Validate SSL and security headers
6. Check Vercel deployment logs for any issues

### Environment Variables Configured:
- âœ… `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (development & production)
- âœ… `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (development & production)

### Deployment Configuration:
- Framework: Vite
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Install command: `npm ci`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Application accessible at production URL
- [ ] All environment variables working
- [ ] Supabase connection established in production
- [ ] No console errors on production site
- [ ] Performance acceptable (< 3s load time)

## Progress Log
- **2025-08-07**: Ticket created
- **2025-08-07**: Environment variables configured for Vercel
- **2025-08-07**: Previous deployment attempts failed due to build errors

## Related Issues
- **[ST-001]**: Fix TypeScript compilation errors (blocking dependency)
- **[ST-003]**: Implement smoke testing suite (depends on this)
- **[ST-004]**: Validate Supabase data sync (depends on this)
