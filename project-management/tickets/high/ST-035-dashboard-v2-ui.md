# ST-035 Dashboard v2 UI

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Sprint:** Phase 5  
**Story Points:** 8

## Overview
Complete redesign of the Dashboard overview with glassmorphic design system, enhanced Recharts integration, and time-range filtering capabilities.

## Requirements
- [x] Rebuild "Overview" cards to match Figma (glassmorphic, shadows, gradients)
- [x] Integrate new Recharts theme (rounded corners, gradient fills)
- [x] Add time-range selector (7d / 30d / YTD)
- [x] Implement responsive glassmorphic design system
- [x] Enhanced chart theming for all modes (light/dark/stealth-ops)

## Technical Implementation

### ðŸ“¦ New Components Created
1. **`StatCard`** (`src/components/ui/stat-card.tsx`)
   - Glassmorphic design variants (default, glass, elevated)
   - Trend indicators with directional arrows
   - Responsive sizing (sm, md, lg)
   - Theme-aware styling for all modes

2. **`TimeRangeSelector`** (`src/components/ui/time-range-selector.tsx`)
   - Time range filtering: 7d, 30d, YTD, All Time
   - Glassmorphic button styling
   - Date range calculation utilities

3. **`ChartTheme`** (`src/components/ui/chart-theme.tsx`)
   - Multi-theme chart configurations (light, dark, stealth-ops)
   - Gradient definitions for SVG charts
   - Enhanced tooltip, grid, and axis configurations
   - Theme-aware color palettes

### ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced Dashboard Features
- **Glassmorphic Design System**: Backdrop blur, transparency, subtle shadows
- **Time-Based Filtering**: Dynamic data filtering based on selected time range
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Trend calculations and comparison indicators
- **Improved Charts**: 
  - Pie charts with donut style and gradients
  - Area charts with gradient fills and rounded corners
  - Theme-responsive color schemes
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first responsive grid system

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements
1. **Visual Polish**: 
   - Glass morphism effects with backdrop-blur
   - Gradient overlays and subtle shadows
   - Smooth hover transitions and animations

2. **Enhanced Data Visualization**:
   - Recharts integration with custom themes
   - Gradient fills and rounded chart elements  
   - Interactive tooltips with glassmorphic styling

3. **Time Intelligence**:
   - Dynamic filtering by time ranges
   - Trend analysis and period comparisons
   - Historical data visualization

4. **Multi-Theme Support**:
   - Light mode: Clean, modern glassmorphic design
   - Dark mode: Enhanced contrast with glass effects
   - Stealth Ops: Tactical styling with minimal glass effects

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Complete redesign with v2 implementation
- `src/components/ui/stat-card.tsx` - NEW: Glassmorphic stat cards
- `src/components/ui/time-range-selector.tsx` - NEW: Time filtering component
- `src/components/ui/chart-theme.tsx` - NEW: Enhanced chart theming system

## CSS Features Utilized
- Glassmorphism utilities from `src/styles/globals.css`
- Custom CSS properties for glass effects
- Theme-aware conditional styling
- Responsive design patterns

## Testing Considerations
- [x] Visual testing across all themes (light/dark/stealth-ops)
- [x] Responsive behavior on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [x] Time range filtering functionality
- [x] Chart interactions and animations
- [x] Accessibility considerations for glass morphism

## Performance Notes
- Optimized chart rendering with memoization
- Efficient theme detection using document classes
- Minimal re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- SVG gradient definitions for performance

## Deliverables
âœ… **ST-035 "Dashboard v2 UI"** - Complete glassmorphic dashboard redesign
