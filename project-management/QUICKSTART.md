# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - SubTracker AI Project Management

## Getting Started in 2 Minutes

### 1. Check Current Status
```powershell
# View current sprint and ticket counts
./project-management/scripts/pm.ps1 status
```

### 2. View Critical Tickets (Start Here!)
```powershell
# See what needs immediate attention
./project-management/scripts/pm.ps1 list critical
```

### 3. Work on a Ticket
1. Open the ticket file (e.g., `tickets/critical/ST-001-typescript-compilation-errors.md`)
2. Update status to `🔄 In Progress`
3. Add progress notes as you work
4. Move to `✅ Done` when complete

### 4. Create New Tickets
```powershell
# Interactive ticket creation
./project-management/scripts/pm.ps1 create -Title "Add new feature" -Priority high -Estimate M -Tags "feature ui/ux"
```

## 📋 Current Priority: Fix Build Issues

**Your immediate focus should be**:
1. **[ST-001]** Fix TypeScript compilation errors (CRITICAL - blocks everything)
2. **[ST-002]** Complete production deployment (CRITICAL - needed for validation)

## 📊 Daily Workflow

### Morning (5 minutes):
1. Run `./pm.ps1 status` to see current state
2. Review your in-progress tickets
3. Plan the day's work

### During Work:
- Update ticket progress in real-time
- Add notes about challenges/solutions
- Move tickets between Todo → In Progress → Done

### End of Day (5 minutes):
1. Update all ticket statuses
2. Note any blockers or discoveries
3. Plan next day's priorities

## 🎯 Sprint 1 Goals (Current)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript build errors
- [ ] Deploy to production successfully  
- [ ] Complete post-deployment validation
