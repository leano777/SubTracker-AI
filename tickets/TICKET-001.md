# [TICKET-001] Interface Compatibility Issues

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Assignee:** Development Team  
**Estimated:** 4 hours  
**Sprint:** Interface Standardization & Build Fixes  

## Description
Multiple components are experiencing type mismatches between FullSubscription and Subscription interfaces, causing build-blocking TypeScript errors.

## Problem Statement
Components throughout the application are expecting the base `Subscription` interface but receiving `FullSubscription` objects. This is causing type safety errors and preventing successful compilation.

**Current Error Examples:**
```
Type 'FullSubscription[]' is not assignable to type 'Subscription[]'
Types of property 'subscriptionType' are incompatible
Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type '"personal" | "business"'
```

## Files Affected
- `src/App.tsx` (lines 774, 1030) - Props passing to IntelligenceTab and ImportDialog
- `src/components/IntelligenceTab.tsx` (line 23) - Props interface definition
- `src/components/ImportDialog.tsx` (line 33) - existingSubscriptions prop type
- `src/components/CalendarView.tsx` (line 44) - subscriptions prop type
- `src/components/PlanningTab.tsx` (line 405) - subscriptions prop to CalendarView

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components accept correct subscription interface types
- [ ] No TS2322 type mismatch errors in build output
- [ ] Proper type casting or interface alignment implemented
- [ ] Components maintain their intended functionality
- [ ] No runtime errors introduced by type changes

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Options:
1. **Update component interfaces** to accept `FullSubscription[]` instead of `Subscription[]`
2. **Create adapter functions** to convert FullSubscription to Subscription where needed
3. **Extend Subscription interface** to be compatible with FullSubscription
4. **Use type assertions** where interfaces are compatible but TypeScript can't infer

### Recommended Solution:
Update component prop interfaces to accept `FullSubscription[]` since this provides more complete data and maintains type safety.

```typescript
// Before
interface IntelligenceTabProps {
  subscriptions: Subscription[];
}

// After  
interface IntelligenceTabProps {
  subscriptions: FullSubscription[];
}
```

## Dependencies
- None

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify all affected components render properly
- [ ] Test prop passing throughout component tree
- [ ] Ensure no regression in subscription data display
- [ ] Manual testing of subscription-related features

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code complete - all interface mismatches resolved
- [ ] Tests passing - no TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Code reviewed - type safety maintained
- [ ] No build errors/warnings related to subscription interfaces
- [ ] Components function identically to before changes
